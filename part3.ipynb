       "1  I think one may be a outlier, misslabeled example or possibly an early-malignant tumor?. Its characteristics are more similar to that of benign tumors but it is classified as malignant. Im a little hesitant around this point, if its properly labeled, its likely a very important point to train on because it seems to be a 'harder' tumor to find, but if its an improperly labeled point, I would remove it from the dataset.  \n",
